_2026-10-11 · scope: 79 commits since 2026-10-04 · 159 test files / 3021 tests (3 skipped) · tsc --noEmit clean · vite build OK_

🟢 **Build health**
- `vite build` emits `index-BGht43z5.js` at 3,039 kB (949 kB gzip). Rollup warns on chunks > 500 kB (elk 1.4 MB, cynefin 690 kB, cytoscape 443 kB, katex 261 kB). Pre-existing; no new import added this week. No action required this cycle.

🟡 **fileTreeStore.ts:955-962 — coalescing only replaces one pending caller's resolve**
The `pendingRecentNotesSync` slot holds a single `resolve` ref. When caller A schedules the sync and caller B (within the 300 ms window) calls `syncRecentNotesWidget`, B's promise replaces A's resolve; A never resolves. Callers that `await` the result (e.g. post-mutation UI refresh) can hang if they're not the last caller in a burst.
Suggested fix: change `pendingRecentNotesSync.resolve` to an array of resolvers, push on each coalesced call, and call all of them in the `finally` block.

🟡 **fileTreeStore.test.ts:1721-1755 — three `it.skip` tests cover the coalescing path under test**
The skipped tests are exactly the ones that would exercise the race condition above (burst coalescing, bridge-failure resolution, double-call). They are disabled, so the bug is invisible in CI.
Suggested fix: un-skip after fixing the resolver-array issue; the `afterEach` `_resetRecentNotesSyncForTest` is already wired.

🟡 **HighlightColorPicker.tsx:70-75 — ref-cached handlers capture a stale `onColorSelect` closure**
`colorHandlers.current[choice.color]` is created once (first render) and caches a closure over `onColorSelect` from that render. If the parent re-renders with a new `insert`/`onClose`, the cached handlers still call the old `onColorSelect` (which calls the old `insert`/`onClose`). The `onPlainSelect` `useCallback` is correctly re-created each render, so the Plain swatch is fine; the six colour swatches are not.
Suggested fix: store the current `onColorSelect` in a ref (`onColorSelectRef.current = onColorSelect` on every render) and have the cached handlers read `onColorSelectRef.current(choice.color)`.

🟢 **FolderAccessPlugin.java — `readBoundedBytes` refactor is sound**
The 8 MiB cap (`MAX_READ_FILE_BYTES`) matches `SEARCH_BATCH_MAX_BYTES` in `fileTreeStore.ts:613`. The cap is checked after each 8 KiB chunk write, so the overshoot is bounded to ≤ 8 KiB. `StandardCharsets.UTF_8` is used consistently (import at line 19). `readOneFileOrNull` returns `null` on overflow (catch-all), which is correct for the batch path. No issues found.

🟢 **FolderAccessPlugin.java:852-867 — `updateRecentNotesWidget` now persists mtime/size**
`entry.getLong("mtime")` and `entry.getLong("size")` are guarded by `entry.has()` + `!entry.isNull()`, so optional fields degrade gracefully. The TS side (`selectRecentNotes`) passes `f.mtime` / `f.size` which are optional on `FsEntry`. The `RecentNotesWidgetEntry` interface (`capacitorBridgeImpl.ts`) documents both as optional. No issues found.

🟢 **platform.ts — `resetPlatformCacheForTests` is test-only and correctly named**
The cache-reset function is exported with a `_ForTests` suffix, is only called from test files, and does not affect production. No issues found.

🟢 **App.tsx — `open-favorites` now clears `taskHubOpen`/`collectionsOpen`**
Two additional `.value = false` assignments alongside the existing `bookmarksOpen = true` / `tagsOpen = false`. Correct: without clearing the other panels, the Bookmarks panel would not render (only one panel is visible at a time). Test added in `App.test.tsx`. No issues found.

🟢 **SettingsPanel.tsx — `handleExportSettings`**
Uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` to deep-clone `workspaceSettings` (fine for a plain object), exports via `exportTextFileViaDialog`, and surfaces errors with `window.alert`. No secret data in the payload (no tokens, no credentials). Test added. No issues found.

🟢 **ci-local.sh — Android SDK auto-detect + proxy**
The SDK auto-detect looks in `$HOME/Android/Sdk` and is a no-op when that directory is absent; no proxy settings are injected any more. `QUICK` is now overridable via `CI_LOCAL_QUICK` env var. No issues found.

🟢 **generate-docs-icon.py — pure-stdlib PNG/ICNS generation**
Deterministic, no external deps. 7 test cases in `scripts/test_docs_icon.py` all pass. No issues found.

🟢 **Flatpak manifest — Node 20 → 22 migration**
`node20` → `node22` SDK extension; `npm_config_offline` removed with a well-documented rationale (make-fetch-happen only-if-cached mode). Commit pin updated from `eb98b1a` to `f87bc5a`. `node-sources.json` / `cargo-sources.json` regenerated. No issues found.
